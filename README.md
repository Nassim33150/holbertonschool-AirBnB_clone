# Project Air_BNB Clone 

We've created a python interpreter for our clone of the AirBnb site.




## Console 
The console we have created takes into account a basic model.
It allows you to use various commands such as EOF, Help, Quit, Create, Show, All, Destroy and Update.

To access the command, you need to write "console.py" and this will open the interface, which will be displayed as shown below:


## Examples

Command Help



Command create



Command all



Command show



Command update
